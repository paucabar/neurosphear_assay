## Requirements

* [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/)
* [ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) 1.3.3
* _BaSiC_ update site (Fiji)
* _ilastik_ update site (Fiji). Once added, it is important to configure the ilastik executable location within the Fiji's plugin.
* _Morphology_ update site (Fiji)
* Image dataset following an IN Cell Analyzer file naming convention (note that the NeuroMol update site includes a [macroinstruction](https://github.com/paucabar/other_macros) to turn data acquired with diferent high content microscopes into an IN Cell Analyzer file naming convention dataset)

How to [follow an update site](https://imagej.net/Following_an_update_site) in Fiji

## Installation

1. Start Fiji
2. Start the **ImageJ Updater** (<code>Help > Update...</code>)
3. Click on <code>Manage update sites</code>
4. Click on <code>Add update site</code>
5. A new blank row is to be created at the bottom of the update sites list
6. Type **NeuroMol Lab** in the **Name** column
7. Type **https://sites.imagej.net/NeuroMol-Lab/** in the **URL** column
8. <code>Close</code> the update sites window
9. <code>Apply changes</code>
10. Restart Fiji
11. Check if <code>NeuroMol Lab</code> appears now in the <code>Plugins</code> dropdown menu (note that it will be placed at the bottom of the dropdown menu)

## Test Dataset

Download an example [image dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1W_UDxg4mbQ1qNeZo1tPUezNgmZxtMwkv?usp=sharing) and some [ilastik classifiers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mgT7NOzUn5zvgJp47WbMRDCNR9f6efXg?usp=sharing) which have been trained using the same subset of images and user annotations but different sets of features. Please note that the image dataset includes a TXT file containing some technical specifications, which are crucial to set the macro parameters. Additionally, along with the ilastik classifiers, another TXT file provides major information regarding their technical specifications, as well as their performance, in order to guide the user when picking up one for the analysis.

## Usage

### Illumination Correction (NFA)

1. Run the **Illumination Correction** macro (<code>Plugins > NeuroMol-Lab > Neurosphere Assay > Illumination Correction</code>)
2. Select the directory containing the images (TIF files)
3. Select the illumination correction mode. The **retrospective multi-image** method is the easiest to apply, since it does not require reference images. However, since this method calculates the illumination correction from the image datset, it requires a medium-size dataset in order to perform a proper estimation (>25-30 wells). Alternatively, the **prospective** method uses reference images, e.g., images acquired on plates without any specimen, just the background. Note that this method will ask for an additional folder containing the reference images to apply the correction function. 
4. Run
5. Corrected images will be saved as H5 files in a new subfolder (named adding the tag _corrected_) within the original directory, whereas illumination functions will be saved as TIF files in a different subfolder (named adding the tag _flat-field_).

### Pixel Classification: training a new classifier within ilastik (optional)

1. Start a pixel classification project in ilastik
2. Load some corrected images (H5 files). Try to use images with different appearence, from several field-of-view positions and wells
3. Select some features (you can start by selecting all of them)
4. Annotate the images. Note that label 1 must correspond to _background_, label 2 to _neurospheres_ and label 3 to _well edges_
5. If it takes too much time to perform the classification, ilastik includes implemented algorithms to keep the major features (look at the features applet)
5. Once the classifier performs fine, set up the prediction export applet: i) set _Probabilities_ at the souce drop-down menu; ii) check _Renormalize_ (from 0 to 1)
6. Save the project

### Pixel Classification & Stitching

1. Run the **Pixel Classification & Stitching** macro (<code>Plugins > NeuroMol-Lab > Neurosphere Assay > Pixel Classification & Stitching</code>)
2. Select the directory containing the corrected images (H5 files)
3. Load the ilastik pixel classifier (ILP file)
4. Select the stitching mode. Note that it depends on the image acquisition parameters. Also note that the macro assumes an overlapping of 15 %
5. Adjust some workflow parameters (mean, threshold, open iterations). Know more about the parameters of the workflow on the **wiki page (not yet)**
6. Run. Note that the stitching workflow may take several hours, depending on the dataset size
7. A series of new files will be saved within different directories: stitched brightfield and probability maps files (TIF), a results table file (CSV) and the ROI files (ZIP) of each well

### Segmentation

Since the **Pixel Classification & Stitching** macro requiures a significative amount of computational time (which is mainly due to the pixel classification and, to a lesser extent, the stitching step), the **Segmentation** macro enables to reset the segmentation parameters and quickly test them on the already stitched probability maps.

1. Run the **Segmentation** macro (<code>Plugins > NeuroMol-Lab > Neurosphere Assay > Segmentation</code>)
2. Select the directory containing the stitching output (a folder tagged with the postfix _corrected_stitched_). The folder must contain two subfolders: _Pixel_Prediction_Map_ and _Raw_Data_. Please note that the TIF files stored on both subfolders should never be reallocated or modified in any way in order to be reused with the **Segmentation** macro.
3. Adjust some workflow parameters (mean, threshold, open iterations). Know more about the parameters of the workflow on the **wiki page (not yet)**
4. Run
5. Note that the macro will generate a new results table (CSV), but the ROI files (ZIP) will be aur¡tomatically replaced. The stitched images, both brightfield and probability maps, will not be modified.
